      Cloud.gov developed an Incident Response Guide documenting the procedures required by the 18F and GSA Incident Response Policy.
      The guide is disseminated to the whole cloud.gov team to ensure everyone is aware of its existence and contents.
      The incident response guide can be found here: https://docs.cloud.gov/ops/security-ir/ and it is continually updated based on the changes on the team and the platform.

      Cloud.gov implements automated processes to detect and analyze malicious activity within the platform.
      If a malicious activity is detected, it is reported to the cloud.gov operations team which in turn is able to use automated tools to eradicate the threat and recover to a known state.
      Cloud.gov uses a service oriented architecture that allows natural containment and separation.

      Cloud.gov developed both an incident response guide and checklist to implement incident response capabilities.
      Given the small nature of the cloud.gov team the strucure of the incident response is clear and concise naming the incident commander the first responder to the event.
      The document provides clear guidance on what steps to take on each situation and how reporting should be handled.
      The guide empowers the incident commander to leverage as many resources from GSA and 18F as needed during the response process.
      The incident response documentation is continually reviewed and updated by the cloud.gov team and approved annually by the Authorizing Official.
