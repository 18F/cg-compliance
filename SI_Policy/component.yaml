      18F identifies all system flaws related to Cloud.gov, reports
      system flaws to information system owners, Authorizing officials, DevOps and
      SecOp  and corrects information system flaws that affect cloud.gov
      Cloud Foundry
      manages software vulnerability using releases and BOSH stemcells. New Cloud
      Foundry releases are created with updates to address code issues, while new
      stemcells are created with patches for the latest security fixes to address
      any underlying operating system issues. New Cloud Foundry releases are located
      at https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release.
      18F implements the release
      of Cloud Foundry he what (or the software developer/vendor in the case of software
      developed and maintained by a vendor/contractor) promptly installs newly released
      security relevant patches and tests patches, for effectiveness and potential
      side effects on information systems before installation.

      The 18F DevOps and SecOps teams monitors the Cloud.Gov information
      system to detect potential attacks and intrusions from internal and external
      sources in accordance with the 18F System Information and Integrity Policy section
      3 - Information System monitoring, the FedRAMP Incident communication procedures
      and GSA CIO-IT Security-08-39 section "System Monitoring / Audit Record

      18F identifies un-authorized access to the Cloud.Gov information system using automated monitoring
      tools within its virutal proviate cloud for monitoringing, log management and
      event analysis. 18F monitors for attacks and indicators of potential attacks,
      unauthorized local, network, and remote connections.

      The infrastructure
      that hosts Cloud.Gov provides monitoring and intrusion detcetion of unsual activity
      at the phyical and network layers. 18F is responsible for monitoring everything
      related to its virtual infrastructure and has deployed monitoring  and intrusion
      dectction tools within its virtual private cloud to log and dectect malicious
      activities to its information systems including Cloud.Gov.

      18F ensures intrusion and monitoring tools are protected  from unauthorized access
      by only granting access to certian members from the DevOps and SecOps team.
      All monitoring and intrusion information data is protected by limiting accounts
      to authorized privileged users only and is maintained in secured repositories
      for review by those members.

      Information system monitoring will
      be heightened based on advisories from Pivotal, US-CERT Advisories, commercial

      18F provides monitoring of all information system components in the event
      of an event or incident, information will be provided as it is available.  Scheduled
      reports will be provided for events such as after-hours administrative logins,
      users being added to privileged groups, persistent malware detections, etc.
      to designated members of the DevOps teams and SecOps teams as needed.
