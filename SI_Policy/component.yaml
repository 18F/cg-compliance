      18F identifies all system flaws related to cloud.gov, reports
      system flaws to information system owners, Authorizing officials, DevOps and
      SecOp  and corrects information system flaws that affect cloud.gov

      Cloud Foundry manages software vulnerability using releases and BOSH stemcells.
      New Cloud Foundry releases are created with updates to address code issues, while new
      stemcells are created with patches for the latest security fixes to address
      any underlying operating system issues. New Cloud Foundry releases are located
      at https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release.

      18F implements the release of Cloud Foundry he what (or the software
      developer/vendor in the case of software developed and maintained by a
      vendor/contractor) promptly installs newly released security relevant
      patches and tests patches, for effectiveness and potential
      side effects on information systems before installation.
