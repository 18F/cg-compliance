        a: |
          18F identifies all system flaws related to Cloud.gov, reports system flaws to information system owners, Authorizing officials, DevOps and SecOp  and corrects information system flaws that affect Cloud.Gov
          Cloud Foundry manages software vulnerability using releases and BOSH stemcells. New Cloud Foundry releases are created with updates to address code issues, while new stemcells are created with patches for the latest security fixes to address any underlying operating system issues. New Cloud Foundry releases are located at https://github.com/Cloud Foundry/cf-release.
          18F implemenets the release of Cloud Foundy he what (or the software developer/vendor in the case of software developed and maintained by a vendor/contractor) promptly installs newly released security relevant patches and tests patches, for effectiveness and potential side effects on information systems before installation.

          The 18F DevOps and SecOps teams monitors the Cloud.Gov information system to detect potential attacks and intrusions from internal and external sources in accordance with the 18F System Information and Integrity Policy section 3 - Information System monitoring, the FedRAMP Incident communication procedures and GSA CIO-IT Security-08-39 section “System Monitoring / Audit Record Review “ for GSA specifc infomation systems
        b: |
          18F identifies un-authorized access to the Cloud.Gov information system using   automated monitoring tools within its virutal proviate cloud for monitoringing, log management and event analysis. 18F monitors for attacks and indicators of potential attacks,  unauthorized local, network, and remote connections.
        c: |
          The infrastructure that hosts Cloud.Gov provides monitoring and intrusion detcetion of unsual activity at  the phyical and network layers. 18F is responsible for monitoring everything related to its virtual infrastructure and has deployed monitoring  and intrusion dectction tools within its virtual private cloud to log and dectect malicious activities to its information systems including Cloud.Gov.
        d: |
          18F ensures intrusion and monitoring tools are protected  from unauthorized access by only granting access to certian members from the DevOps and SecOps team. All monitoring and intrusion information data is protected by limiting accounts to authorized privileged users only and is maintained in secured repositories for review by those members.
        e: |
          Information system monitoring will be heightened based on advisories from Pivitol, US-CERT Advisories, commercial security communities, and other sources.
        f: |
          Information system monitoring will be conducted in accordance and compliance with 18F security policies and all applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, and regulations.
        g: |
         18F provides monitoring of all information system components in the event of an event or incident, information will be provided as it is available.  Scheduled reports will be provided for events such as after-hours administrative logins, users being added to privileged groups, persistent malware detections, etc. to designated members of the DevOps teams and SecOps teams as needed
