      narrative:
        a: |
          All Configuration Change control:
          18F provisions its infrastructure with AWS CloudFormation, the AWS CloudFormation template describes exactly what resources are provisioned and their settings. Because these templates are text files, 18F can simply track differences in these templates to track changes to its infrastructure, similar to the way developers control revisions to source code.
          18F uses version control systems with its cloud formation templates to know exactly what changes were made, who made them, and when. If at any point 18F needs to reverse changes to infrastructure, you can use a previous version of a template.
          18F uses GitHub for additional tracking and documenting of authorized changes within the infrastructure and applications including Cloud Foundry platform as a service. Within  GitHub, a diff function is used to compare and contrast any changes made to configurations of Cloud Foundry.
        b: |
          18F reviews proposed configuration-controlled changes to all of its information systems and infrastructure and approves or disapproves such changes with explicit consideration for security impact analysis within the Virtual Private Cloud environment. All reviews and approvals are conducted within 18Fs GitHub ticketing and tracking system.
        c: |
          18F uses the following methods to document configuration change decisions associated with its information systems.
          For changes related to the its virtual infrastructure, 18F uses VisualOps and Cloud Checkr for real-time configuration changes which are documented, approved and tracked within GitHub.
          All Cloud Foundry configuration changes are documented, approved and tracked within 18 Fâ€™s GitHub site.
          All configuration changes related to applications and websites hosted within the 18F AWS and Cloud Foundry environment are requested by the systems owner and approved by DevOps within the 18F GitHub tracking systems.
        d: |
          When configuration changes have been approved through 18F's GitHub ticketing and tracking system, the DevOps team implements approved configuration-controlled changes to the information system and then provides a status of the changes completed and closes out the ticket.
        e: |
          Records of configuration-controlled changes are retained for at least 1 year in accordance with the 18F Configuration Management policy and utilizing the 18F GitHub site and S3 to store all changes requested, approved, disapproved, implemented and pending.
        f: |
          Audits for the virtual infrastructure and Cloud Foundry platform as a service and applications are conducted by DevOps, ISSOs and Cloud Foundry project manager of all configuration-controlled changes to the information system.  These audits take place no less than once a month and are documented in the GitHub ticketing and tracking system, per the 18F Configuration management policy Section 3 which states
          18F will conduct a monthly audit of information system which identifies and eliminates unnecessary functions, ports, protocols, and/or services.
        g: |
          18F coordinates and provides oversight for configuration change control activities through its GitHub tracking and ticketing systems and Slack communications channel which is integrated with GitHub that convenes whenever there are significant and pending changes to the 18F security, cloud infrastructure and applications.

      narrative:
        a: |
          18F uses established and documents configuration settings for its information technology products employed within the Cloud Foundry platform that reflect the most restrictive mode consistent with operational requirements. 18F follows industry best practices and guidance provided in NIST Special Publication 800-70, Security Configuration Checklist Program for IT Products
          Infrastructure documented configuration settings:
          DevOps and Security Engineers maintain the baseline configuration for VPC, EBS and AMIs.  Best practices, FISMA compliant AMIs, and hardened cloud formation templates are utilized as there are no benchmarks available. 18F uses the following approved FISMA ready baselines located at https://github.com/fisma-ready
          Cloud Foundry documented configuration settings:
          18F follows Cloud Foundry best practices for configuring and implementing the platform as a service. Configuration settings are documented within the deployment manifest on the GitHub and Cloud Foundry websites. The following are approved baseline configuration settings related to the Cloud Foundry platform as a service. All documented configuration settings  related to Cloud Foundry are located  at https://docs.18f.gov/ops/repos/.

        b: |
          18F Implements the configuration settings based on its documented process and practices. DevOps implements the configuration benchmarks identified in Part a, maintains the baseline configuration for all cloud infrastructure and Cloud Foundry components and is responsible for ensuring all systems are configured in accordance with applicable hardening guides.

        c: |
          DevOps documents any exceptions to established baseline configurations for all of 18F's virtual infrastructure and information systems. 18F maintains exception documents which detail specific items from the established configuration settings which cannot be applied to instances due to operational requirements.
        d: |
          18F Monitors and controls changes to the configuration settings in accordance with its documented configuration management policy and procedures.
          All Configuration Change Control:
          DevOps and 18F system owners maintain the baseline configurations within 18F Virtual Private Cloud. Configuration will be reviewed in real-time using automated methods and at least quarterly to ensure no unauthorized changes were made to the baseline configuration.
          Internal vulnerability scans are performed at least on a quarterly basis in the event that no enhancements or upgrades are performed.
