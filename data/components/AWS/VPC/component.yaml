        18F incorporates security features within its vpc which include security groups, network ACLs, routing tables, and external gateways. Each of these items is complementary to providing a secure, isolated network.
        Network Access control lists (ACLs) are created to allow or deny traffic entering or exiting these subnets. Each subnet has routing tables attached to them to direct the flow of network traffic to Internet gateways, virtual private gateways, Network Address Translation (NAT) for private subnets.
        18F’s virtual private cloud infrastructure has firewalls enabling filtering on both ingress and egress traffic from its instances. The default group enables inbound communication from other members of the same group and outbound communication to any destination.
        Traffic is restricted by IP protocol, by service port, as well as source/destination IP address (individual IP or Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block).

        The virtual private cloud logically separates the Cloud.Gov PaaS from other information systens within its environment. Cloud.gov is hosted within its own VPC and has its own dedicated elastic load balancers for incoming traffic.

        Since the Cloud.Gov platform resides within the 18F virtual infrastructure, 18F Devops must use the SSH remote access method to troubleshoot issues and update services that are only resolved by logging into the Cloud.Gov jumpboxes. The jumpboxes themselves are virtual machine deployed within the 18F’s virtual private cloud. They are the only access points for designated Devops members to run priviledged commnds that affect the entire platform. No other privileged remote access is available to the information system.
