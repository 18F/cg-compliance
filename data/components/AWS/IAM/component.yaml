    AC-2:
      implementation_status: null
      narrative:
        a: |
          AWS accounts are managed through AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM). Only users with a need to operate the AWS management console are provided individual AWS user accounts. The following types are used:
            * User – Individual IAM accounts
            * System – system and application account not used for interactive access
          There are no guest/anonymous, groups, or temporary user accounts in the 18F Environment
    AC-2 (1):
      implementation_status: null
      narrative: |
        Cloud.gov requires the creation of a single system IAM account through a manual process.
    AC-2 (2):
      implementation_status: null
      narrative: |
        This control is not applicable. All Temporary accounts are handled by associating resources with IAM Roles. There are no guest/anonymous, group, or temporary user accounts in the 18F AWS environment.
    AC-2 (5):
      implementation_status: null
      narrative: |
        Account log out is set to 15 minutes of inactivity within the IAM console per accountwithin the 18F virtual infrastructure.
    AC-5:
      implementation_status: null
      narrative:
        a: |
          IAM policies are attached to the users, enabling centralized control of permissions for users under 18Fs AWS Account.
        b: |
          18F documents separation of duties of AWS and Cloud Foundry users. All AWS IAM users, groups and roles can be viewed wthin the AWS console. IAM users reports are generated to show all separation of duties. Cloud Checkr also generates an a report of all IAM users within 18F AWS environment.
    AC-6:
      implementation_status: null
      narrative: |
        IAM policies are attached to the users, enabling centralized control of permissions for users under 18F AWS Account to access services, buckets or objects. With IAM policies, 18F only grant users within its own AWS account permission to access its Amazon resources.
        18F AWS IAM policies are defined to grant only the required access for 18F staff necessary to perform their functions. 18F defines least privilege access to each user, group or role.
        Security functions within the AWS infrastructure are explicitly defined within IAM to include read-only permissions for any user functions.
        18F incorporate running the IAM Policy Simulator to test policies for least privilege access for users and groups.
    AC-6 (1):
      implementation_status: null
      narrative: |
        18F explicitly authorizes access to administrative and security functions of its virtual infrastructure and Cloud.Gov platform to designated individuals within the Devops and SecOps team.  No other authrozations to security and administrative information is granted to individuals outside these teams.
    AC-6 (5):
      implementation_status: null
      narrative: |
        18F restricts privileged accounts such as administrator and root access accounts to designated members within the18F Devops and SecOps teams. Within the virtual infrastructure the admin account is not used for privileged access. It’s only used for billing and metrics.
    AC-14:
      implementation_status: null
      narrative:
        a: |
          There are no user or administrative actions than can be performed within 18F virtual private cloud without multifactor authentication.  Per AWS, users can not gain access to the AWS console without identification and authorization to its a vpc.
        b: |
          It is not possible for members of the 18F Devops and SecOps teams to aceess the 18F virtual private cloud infrastructure without muitifactor authetication and identification. All clinet users of Cloud.gov must login using authenticated credentials in order to access the system as stated in Part A above.
    IA-2:
      implementation_status: null
      narrative: |
        All users have individually unique identifiers to access and authenticate to the AWS environment through the AWS management console. 18F AWS IAM users are placed into IAM roles based on their assigned roles and permissions
        Additional temporary permission are delegated with the IAM roles usually for applications that run on EC2 Instances in order to access AWS resources All user accounts for 18F staff are maintained within the 18F AWS Environment.
        Shared or group authenticators are not utilized, Service accounts are implemented as Managed Services Accounts within AWS.
