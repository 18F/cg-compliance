      narrative:
        j: User accounts will be monitored monthly and accounts will be disabled after 90 days of inactivity; this will be a manual review process every 30 days. 18F is in the process of automating this account management process through the use of implementing AWS OSQuery to trigger alerts when user accounts are inactive of a 90 day period.

        User accounts will be monitored monthly and accounts will be disabled after 90 days of inactivity; this will be a manual review process every 30 days. 18F genereates a credential report that lists all IAM users and the status of their credentials, including passwords, access keys, and MFA devices.

      narrative: |
        18F has implemented cloudtrail for monitoring EC2, EBS, and VPCs that captures API calls and delivers the log files to an S3 bucket. By default, all cloudtrail log files are encrypted by using Amazon S3 server-side encryption (SSE)
        Every log entry contains information about who generated the request. The user identity information in the log helps determine whether the request was made with root or IAM user credentials, with temporary security credentials for a role or federated user, or by another AWS service.
        Secops utilizes Cloud Checkr as a central way to automactically audit account management functions for its virtual infrastrcuture

          18F monitors all privileged role assignments to their vpcs through the AWS IAM console , AWS CloudTrail audit logs and Cloud Watch alerts.  18F uses Cloud Checkr to provide centralized monitoring and alerting within its its VPC.

      narrative:
        a: |
          18F has implemented Cloud Checkr as a way to monitor information system accounts. CloudCheckr monitors the 18F AWS infrastuctureture and alerts the devops and s ecops when certain conditions are met. The CloudTrail Built-In Alerts allows 18F  to monitor for a recommended predefined set of CloudTrail events. These events include:
          * Any security-related event
          * CloudTrail disabled
          * Credentials report generated
          * EBS snapshot deleted
          * EC2 instance terminated
          * Failed login to AWS Management Console
          * IAM access key created
          * IAM access key deleted
          * IAM password policy changed
          * IAM policy assigned
          * IAM policy modified
          * Resource-based policy modified
          * Role Assumed
          * Root account access key created
          * Root account used
          * Security group assigned
          * Security group modified
          * Successful login to AWS Management Console
          * Unauthorized access attempt

          Cloud Checkr reports atypical usage of information system accounts to designated 18F SecOps and Devops teams. Monitoring and intrusion information contained within Cloud Checkr and cloudtrail logs are  sent to 18F security personnel. The  logs are protected from unauthorized access by limiting access to authorized privileged users only.
    AC-6 (9):

      narrative: |
        All  priviledeged user account activity and API calls to Cloud.Gov are auditied by CloudTrail and monitored by CloudWatch.
    AC-17 (1):
      implementation_status: null
      narrative: |
        Cloud Checkr provides a unified view of all infrastructure monitoring which captures all remote activites within 18F virtual infrastructure. The log files are organized by AWS Account ID, region, service name, date, and time. CloudTrail can be configured to aggregate log files from multiple regions into a single Amazon S3 bucket. From there, 18F Devops and SecOps teams view the logs files within Cloud Checkr to perform security analysis and detect user behavior patterns.
