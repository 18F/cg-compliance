      narrative: 'Cloud.Gov uses feature flags which allows an administrator to turn
        on or off sub-sections, or features, of an application without deploying new
        code.

        18F uses Orgs, Spaces, and Roles to implement least privileged access to the
        platform as a service. Cloud.Gov uses role-based access control (RBAC), with
        each role granting permissions in either an org or a space.

    AC-6 (10):

      narrative: 'The Cloud.Gov platform has built-in Role based access controls (RBAC).
        This ensures that users can only view and affect the spaces for which they
        have been granted access to. It also prevents non-privileged users from executing
        privileged functions to include disabling, circumventing, or altering implemented
        security safeguards/countermeasures.

        Only designated Org Managers from the DevOps team can execute privileged functions
        to the Cloud.Gov platform. All other accounts are non-prilviledged accounts.

        Client agencies using Cloud.Gov are only permitted to change settings within
        their associated  Org account, spaces and roles. These accounts do not have
        access to the underlying Cloud.Gov Platform.
