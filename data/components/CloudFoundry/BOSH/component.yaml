        18F utilizes the Cloud Foundry Secure Deployment best practices which include the following:
        Configure UAA clients and users using a standard BOSH manifest for cloud Foundry Deployment. Limit and manage these clients and users as you would any other kind of privileged account.
        Deploy within a VPC that limits network traffic to individual VMs. This reduces the possibility of unauthorized access to the VMs within your BOSH-managed cloud.
        Enable HTTPS for applications and SSL database connections to protect sensitive data transmitted to and from applications.
        Ensure that the jumpbox is secure, along with the load balancer and NAT VM.
        Encrypt stored files and data within databases to meet data security requirements. Deploy using industry standard encryption and the best practices for your language or framework.
        Prohibit promiscuous network interfaces on the trusted network.
        Review and monitor data sharing and security practices with third-party services that you use to provide additional functionality to your application.
        Store SSH keys securely to prevent disclosure, and promptly replace lost or compromised keys.
        Use Cloud Foundry’s RBAC model to restrict users’ access to only what is necessary to complete their tasks.
        Use a strong passphrase for both Cloud Foundry user account and SSH keys.
