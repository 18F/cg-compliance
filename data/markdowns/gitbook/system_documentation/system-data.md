# Cloud Foundry Platform as a Service (Cloud.Gov)
This System Security Plan provides an overview of the security requirements for the Cloud Foundry Platform as a Service (Cloud.Gov) and describes the controls in place or planned for implementation to provide a level of security appropriate for the information to be transmitted, processed or stored by the system.  Information security is vital to our critical infrastructure and its effective performance and protection is a key component of our national security program.  Proper management of information technology systems is essential to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data transmitted, processed or stored by the Cloud.Gov information system.  

The security safeguards implemented for the Cloud.Gov system meet the policy and control requirements set forth in this System Security Plan.  All systems are subject to monitoring consistent with applicable laws, regulations, agency policies, procedures and practices.
