    Authorized federal staff rotate, encrypt, and backup keys monthly. Privileged
    users can access the keys only with two-factor authentication and a decryption
    passphrase. In the rare case that both the keys and the decryption passphrase
    for the backup are lost or compromised, new keys can be rotated in by authorized
    federal staff, while maintaining availability of information.
